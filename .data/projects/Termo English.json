{"id":"k2su5xvif8a1q48iqhk7","name":"Termo English","description":"Termo English made with React. This was my first serious project. It fetches information from an self-made API, and displays it in a nice way. You can also get translations, examples, images for any English word and learn one. It uses React Router, and fetches the vocabulary based on the URL. It also uses Redux to manage state. One of the projects I'm most proud of.","image":"public/img/termoenglish3.png","source":"https://termoenglish.herokuapp.com","type":"react,nodejs","code":""}
